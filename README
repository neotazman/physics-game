# This was made using a tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U34l-Xz5ynU&t=342s

# Things I changed

 1) i made variables for the canvas size so they would reference each other to be the same dimensions -- i don't think this is gonna matter anymore except for making the overlay and the canvas the same size
    a) also i made sure the overlay had the same dimensions as the canvas

2) i put the classes in a separate file

3) i used Math.ceil(Math.random()) to choose number of starting obstacles
