# This was made using a tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U34l-Xz5ynU&t=342s

# Things I changed

 1) i made variables for the canvas size so they would reference each other to be the same dimensions -- i don't think this is gonna matter anymore except for making the overlay and the canvas the same size
    a) also i made sure the overlay had the same dimensions as the canvas

2) i put the classes in a separate file

3) checkCollision returns an object rather than an array to be cleaner and easier when using the values

    physics code that i need to figure out
    //NEED TO REMEMBER THE NEXT FOUR LINES
    const unit_x = dx / distance
    const unit_y = dy / distance
    this.collisionX = obstacle.collisionX + (sumOfRadii + 1) * unit_x
    this.collisionY = obstacle.collisionY + (sumOfRadii + 1) * unit_y
